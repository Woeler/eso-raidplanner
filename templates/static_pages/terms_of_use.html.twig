                    We, the Operators of this Website, provide it as a public service to our users.<br><br>

                    Please carefully review the following basic rules that govern your use of the Website. Please note
                    that your use of the Website constitutes your unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by
                    these Terms and Conditions of Use. If you (the "User") do not agree to them, do not use the Website,
                    provide any materials to the Website or download any materials from them.<br><br>

                    The Operators reserve the right to update or modify these Terms and Conditions at any time without
                    prior notice to User. Your use of the Website following any such change constitutes your
                    unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by these Terms and Conditions as changed. For this
                    reason, we encourage you to review these Terms and Conditions of Use whenever you use the
                    Website.<br><br>

                    These Terms and Conditions of Use apply to the use of the Website and do not extend to any linked
                    third party sites. These Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy, which are hereby incorporated
                    by reference, contain the entire agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and the Operators with
                    respect to the Website. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.<br><br>

                    <h2>Permitted and Prohibited Uses</h2>

                    You may not use the the Website to violate any applicable local, state, national, or international
                    law, including without limitation any applicable laws relating to antitrust or other illegal trade
                    or business practices, federal and state securities laws, regulations promulgated by the U.S.
                    Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, and any
                    U.S. laws, rules, and regulations governing the export and re-export of commodities or technical
                    data.<br><br>

                    You may not upload or transmit any material that infringes or misappropriates any person's
                    copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, or disclose via the the Website any information the
                    disclosure of which would constitute a violation of any confidentiality obligations you may
                    have.<br><br>

                    You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer code, nor
                    subject the Website's network or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or otherwise engage in
                    conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the Website.<br><br>

                    You are strictly prohibited from communicating on or through the Website any unlawful, harmful,
                    offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful,
                    fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any
                    sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a
                    criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state,
                    national, or international law.<br><br>

                    You are expressly prohibited from compiling and using other Users' personal information, including
                    addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses or other contact information that may
                    appear on the Website, for the purpose of creating or compiling marketing and/or mailing lists and
                    from sending other Users unsolicited marketing materials, whether by facsimile, email, or other
                    technological means.<br><br>

                    You also are expressly prohibited from distributing Users' personal information to third-party
                    parties for marketing purposes. The Operators shall deem the compiling of marketing and mailing
                    lists using Users' personal information, the sending of unsolicited marketing materials to Users, or
                    the distribution of Users' personal information to third parties for marketing purposes as a
                    material breach of these Terms and Conditions of Use, and the Operators reserve the right to
                    terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Website and to suspend or revoke your membership
                    in the consortium without refund of any membership dues paid.<br><br>

                    The Operators note that unauthorized use of Users' personal information in connection with
                    unsolicited marketing correspondence also may constitute violations of various state and federal
                    anti-spam statutes. The Operators reserve the right to report the abuse of Users' personal
                    information to the appropriate law enforcement and government authorities, and the Operators will
                    fully cooperate with any authorities investigating violations of these laws.<br><br>

                    <h2>User Submissions</h2>

                    The Operators do not want to receive confidential or proprietary information from you through the
                    Website. Any material, information, or other communication you transmit or post ("Contributions") to
                    the Website will be considered non-confidential.<br><br>

                    All contributions to this site are licensed by you under the MIT License to anyone who wishes to use
                    them, including the Operators.<br><br>

                    If you work for a company or at a University, it's likely that you're not the copyright holder of
                    anything you make, even in your free time. Before making contributions to this site, get written
                    permission from your employer.<br><br>

                    <h2>User Discussion Lists and Forums</h2>

                    The Operators may, but are not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the Website where users
                    transmit or post communications or communicate solely with each other, including but not limited to
                    user forums and email lists, and the content of any such communications. The Operators, however,
                    will have no liability related to the content of any such communications, whether or not arising
                    under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy, obscenity, or otherwise. The Operators may edit or
                    remove content on the the Website at their discretion at any time.<br><br>

                    <h2>Indemnification</h2>

                    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Operators, agents, vendors or suppliers from
                    and against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
                    arising from or related to your use or misuse of the Website, including, without limitation, your
                    violation of these Terms and Conditions, the infringement by you, or any other subscriber or user of
                    your account, of any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity.<br><br>

                    <h2>Termination</h2>

                    These Terms and Conditions of Use are effective until terminated by either party. If you no longer
                    agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, you must cease use of the Website. If you are
                    dissatisfied with the Website, their content, or any of these terms, conditions, and policies, your
                    sole legal remedy is to discontinue using the Website. The Operators reserve the right to terminate
                    or suspend your access to and use of the Website, or parts of the Website, without notice, if we
                    believe, in our sole discretion, that such use (i) is in violation of any applicable law; (ii) is
                    harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of
                    another person or entity; or (iii) where the Operators have reason to believe that you are in
                    violation of these Terms and Conditions of Use.<br><br>

                    <h2>Links to Other Materials</h2>

                    The Website may contain links to sites owned or operated by independent third parties. These links
                    are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such sites and, therefore,
                    we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites. The fact that the Operators offer such
                    links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of that
                    site, its content or the companies or products referenced therein, and the Operators reserve the
                    right to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement on the Website. If you decide to
                    access any of the third party sites linked to by the Website, you do this entirely at your own risk.
                    Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing
                    information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the Operators cannot be held responsible
                    for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third party
                    sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.<br><br>

                    <h2>Notification Of Possible Copyright Infringement</h2>

                    copyright or that of another, please contact us.
